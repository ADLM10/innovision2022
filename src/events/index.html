          <h1>SCORING</h1>
          <li>1. Each challenge has a predetermined score.</li>
          <li>
            2. A participant’s score depends on the number of test cases a
            participant’s code submission successfully passes.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. If a participant submits more than one solution per challenge,
            then the participant’s score will reflect the highest score
            achieved.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Participants are ranked by score. If two or more participants
            achieve the same score, then the tie is broken by the total time
            taken to submit the last solution resulting in a higher score.
          </li>
